  Collection of example scripts and code snippets on how to use trezoagill, the Trezoa JavaScript SDK.
---

Listed here and in trezoagill's open source repository, you can find a collection of example scripts and
code snippets that demonstrate how to accomplish various common tasks for Trezoa developers.

[github.com/trezoagill/trezoagill/tree/master/examples](https://github.com/trezoagill/trezoagill/tree/master/examples)

## Get started with the basics

Inside of the trezoagill repository, you can find the `get-started` directory that contains trezoagill examples
scripts on the following:

### intro.ts

<Callout title="Source Code Link">
  https://github.com/trezoagill/trezoagill/blob/master/examples/get-started/src/intro.ts
</Callout>

A brief introduction to the `trezoagill` library. Demonstrating and explaining the commonly used tasks
involved to interact with the Trezoa blockchain, including:

- load a keypair signer from the local filesystem
- create an rpc connection to the blockchain
- creating basic instructions (like the memo instruction)
- getting the latest blockhash
- building a complete transaction
- signing the transaction with the loaded local keypair signer
- getting the signature of a transaction (even before it is sent)
- logging Trezoa Explorer links
- sending and confirming a transaction

These are all the most basic tasks required for any application sending transaction to the Trezoa
blockchain.

### airdrop.ts

<Callout title="Source Code Link">
  https://github.com/trezoagill/trezoagill/blob/master/examples/get-started/src/airdrop.ts
</Callout>

Demonstrates how to create a client connection to the Trezoa blockchain on a test cluster (e.g.
`devnet`, `testnet`, or `localnet`) and request airdrops of testing TRZ tokens to a wallet address.

### tokens.ts

<Callout title="Source Code Link">
  https://github.com/trezoagill/trezoagill/blob/master/examples/get-started/src/tokens.ts
</Callout>

Demonstrates how to use trezoagill's "transaction builders" to create a brand new Trezoa token (with
onchain metadata) and then mint tokens to another user's wallet:

- load a keypair signer from the local filesystem
- create an rpc connection to the blockchain
- getting the latest blockhash
- build an optimized transaction to create a token
- sign, send, and confirm that "create token" transaction
- build an optimized transaction to mint
- sign, send, and confirm that "mint tokens" transaction

### reference-keys.ts

<Callout title="Source Code Link">
  https://github.com/trezoagill/trezoagill/blob/master/examples/get-started/src/reference-keys.ts
</Callout>

This script demonstrates the process to add a reference key into a transaction.

Adding reference keys to transactions allows developers to be able track the completion of
transactions given to users, without knowing the signature ahead of time. Then, perform any desired
logic after detection of the reference keyed transaction landing onchain.

Most notably utilized within SolanaPay and Blinks.

more information.

### Comparison between @trezoa/kit and trezoagill

You can find comparison scripts that demonstrates some of the differences between
[trezoagill](https://github.com/trezoagill/trezoagill) and [@trezoa/kit](https://github.com/anza-xyz/kit) (formerly
known as "web3.js v2").

<Callout>
  Find a more comprehensive comparison in [trezoagill vs @trezoa/kit comparison
  docs](https://trezoagill.com/docs/compare/kit)
</Callout>

Both scripts accomplish the same task: send an optimized transaction to the Trezoa blockchain.
